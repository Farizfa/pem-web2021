00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.360
right now

3
00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.080
we're facing a man-made disaster

4
00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:20.560
of global scale

5
00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:22.560
our greatest threat in thousands of

6
00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.240
years

7
00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.119
climate change

8
00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:30.800
if we don't take action

9
00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.160
the collapse of our civilizations

10
00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.000
and the extinction

11
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.399
of much of the natural world

12
00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.010
is on the horizon

13
00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:42.480
[Music]

14
00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.160
the world's people have spoken

15
00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.200
their message is clear

16
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.800
time is running out

17
00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:54.960
the amount of carbon dioxide in the

18
00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.879
atmosphere now is 50 higher than it was

19
00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:00.480
in 1900

20
00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.800
and not only are we piling in more and

21
00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.519
more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere

22
00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.840
but we are chopping down the forests of

23
00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:09.920
the earth at a great rate

24
00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.240
and the forests themselves are the most

25
00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.680
efficient consumers of carbon dioxide

26
00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:17.920
that there are on earth

27
00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.479
we're going to destroy the ground

28
00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:22.720
because the soil of a rainforest isn't

29
00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:25.759
very good we are actually tampering with

30
00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:27.520
the climate of the earth and with the

31
00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.799
very atmosphere that we breathe

32
00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:33.520
when we talk about the disappearance of

33
00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.520
the ozone layer

34
00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.680
we don't know what will happen when the

35
00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.400
ozone layer goes

36
00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.520
the world has become so fragile

37
00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.000
that we cannot subject the earth

38
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.560
to the tortures we can now inflict upon

39
00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:50.079
it

40
00:01:50.079 --> 00:01:53.119
when we talk about the greenhouse effect

41
00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:55.439
we're talking about something

42
00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:58.719
that affects the entire earth

43
00:01:58.719 --> 00:02:00.960
and these problems are life and death

44
00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.079
problems

45
00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:05.040
they go to the root of the viability of

46
00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.840
the planet itself

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:28.160
[Music]

48
00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:29.640
so there's one thing that is

49
00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.000
biologically certain

50
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.840
about the human species is that it is a

51
00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:37.599
human species

52
00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:40.400
one species

53
00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.879
if we don't stop the destruction of our

54
00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:47.280
natural world nothing else will matter

55
00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:52.480
simply put if we don't protect nature

56
00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:56.519
we can't protect ourselves

57
00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:02.860
[Music]

58
00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:09.519
the only way we can solve a problem

59
00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:12.640
is by a human solution

60
00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.120
never can we sit back and wait for

61
00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.120
miracles to save us

62
00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.280
miracles don't happen

63
00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:20.959
sweat happens

64
00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:22.800
efforts happens

65
00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.780
thought happens
